# gym-equipment-online-store

# What I Created:

- This project was a online store for gym equipment.
- The store is responsive for computer, laptop and mobile devices.
- Includes a search bar that allows filtering through the store for specific items.
  - Takes into account uppercase, lowercase and numbers.
  - If no results are found a message pops into the main container.
- There is a selection section that allows for the filtering of the store alphabetically, by price (highest to lowest or lowest to highest)
- Each item has an add to cart button and when clicked it adds the item to your cart.
  - This updates the number in the circle by the cart to show how many items there are.
- Clicking on the cart button takes you to the cart page which has all the items listed and a calculation table for cost.
- It updates as you delete items.

# What I used

-HTML
-CSS
-JavaScript

# Biggest Takeaways

- Structure of local storage.
- Keeping functions such as rendering lists and objects simple.
- Each function performs one task in a sense do not make one function perform too much.

# Overall Breakdown

- I enjoyed this project.
- This was not an overly complicated project but at times simple tasks I over thought and made more complicated requiring more time.
- Rendering everything from javascript is just an absolutely amazing process but requires managment of function order, process order and not repeating yourself.
